# 5000 Words - Enhanced Learning Features

## Overview

The 5000 Words French learning app has been significantly enhanced with a comprehensive learning system featuring spaced repetition, queue management, and advanced progress tracking. This document outlines all the new features and improvements.

## 🎯 Core Learning System

### Spaced Repetition Algorithm
- **Three-tier review system**: Pool-based system with configurable intervals
- **Adaptive scheduling**: Words move between tiers based on user performance

- **3 Consecutive Rule**: 3 correct answers advance, 3 wrong answers demote
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Automated spaced repetition with QueueManager optimization

### Learning Modes
- **Learning Mode**: Work through new vocabulary in both directions
- **Reviews Mode**: Focus on spaced repetition of previously learned words
- **Auto-switching**: System intelligently suggests mode based on due reviews
