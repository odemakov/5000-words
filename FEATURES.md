# 5000 Words - Enhanced Learning Features

## Overview

The 5000 Words French learning app has been significantly enhanced with a comprehensive learning system featuring spaced repetition, queue management, and advanced progress tracking. This document outlines all the new features and improvements.

## 🎯 Core Learning System

### Spaced Repetition Algorithm
- **Three-tier review system**: Pool-based system with configurable intervals
- **Adaptive scheduling**: Words move between tiers based on user performance
- **Forgetting curve optimization**: Reviews scheduled at optimal intervals for retention

### Queue Management
- **Forward Queue**: French → Russian translation (30 cards max)
- **Backward Queue**: Russian → French translation (30 cards max)
- **Review Queues**: Separate queues for each spaced repetition tier
- **Smart refilling**: 80% new words, 20% due reviews for optimal learning balance

### Learning Modes
- **Learning Mode**: Work through new vocabulary in both directions
- **Reviews Mode**: Focus on spaced repetition of previously learned words
- **Auto-switching**: System intelligently suggests mode based on due reviews

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. Enhanced User Interface

#### Progress Header
- **Real-time progress tracking** with visual progress bar
- **Level-specific progress** (A1: 1-800, A2: 801-2000, etc.)
- **Words learned counter** with formatted numbers (1.2k, etc.)
- **Quick settings access** via header button

#### Mode Selector
- **Visual mode switching** between Learning and Reviews
- **Smart availability indicators** - modes disabled when no cards available
- **Due review notifications** with red badge showing count

- **Visual progress indicators** with color-coded review tiers
- **Alert notifications** when reviews are overdue

### 2. Advanced Flashcard System

#### Direction-Aware Cards
- **Forward direction**: French word → Russian translations
- **Backward direction**: Russian word → French word
- **Context indicators**: Clear labeling of source and target languages
- **Properties display**: Grammatical information adapted to direction

#### Review Indicators

- **Color-coded system**: Yellow (Pool 1), Orange (Pool 2), Green (Pool 3)
- **Progress tracking**: Shows which pool each review card belongs to

### 3. Comprehensive Settings Panel

#### Statistics Dashboard
- **Daily progress tracking**: New words, reviews, time spent
- **Streak counter**: Consecutive days of study
- **Session analytics**: Real-time activity monitoring

#### Personalization Options

```

#### Adaptive Response Processing
- **Forward queue success**: Moves to backward queue for bidirectional learning
- **Forward queue failure**: Reinserts at position 10-30 for spaced repetition
- **Backward queue success**: Graduates to Pool 1 review queue
- **Review promotion**: Pool 1 → Pool 2 → Pool 3 → Fully learned
- **Review demotion**: Failed reviews move back to previous pool or learning queues

#### Level-Based Progression

### 6. Data Architecture

#### Optimized Storage
```typescript
// Efficient word storage - only indices stored
interface WordInQueue {
  wordIndex: number;    // Reference to main word array
  addedAt: number;      // Timestamp for analytics
  attempts: number;     // Learning progress tracking
}

interface ReviewWord extends WordInQueue {
  dueDate: number;           // Next review date
  pool: 'POOL1' | 'POOL2' | 'POOL3';  // Current review pool
}
```

#### Session Management
